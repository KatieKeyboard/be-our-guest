# be-our-guest
A guided-tutorial project ("Meal Maker") from the Codecademy library, now with dishes themed to "Be Our Guest" by Disney's Beauty & The Beast to add more flavor!

JavaScript is used to randomly create a three-course meal from a menu.   

Put our service to the test! It may be run until one is satisfied with the generated meal.  
Bon app√©tit!
